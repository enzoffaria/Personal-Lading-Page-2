# Personal-Lading-Page-2
made using html, css and js. This is my second personal website made to test some knowledge, it's also the first time I work with the option of color themes on the website.

I focused on responsiveness and I was very pleased with the result, but I keep trying to evolve to find errors that I still don't see today.
